Create Docker Image by running mvn clean package docker:build.
Looking at the docker compose file, we have listed 2 images mongodb image and application image.
When i run docker-compose with building the docker images, i got error where docker compose could not dlook for images.
Hence, I build application image by running mvn clean package bocker:build which will generate image

Run docker-compose file by running docker-compose up command which will look for docker images

Use curl to upload some data to application

$ curl -i -X POST -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d '{  "firstName" : "Harish",  "lastName" : "Kadamudi" }' http://localhost:8080/people
$ curl http://localhost:8080/people

Now, the interesting question is how to connect to mongodb instance.

docker exec -it 73039eaf69c5 /entrypoint.sh mongo

By default spring boot application will connect to test collections. Use test collection and look for person document

db.person.find()
